	    A separate room will be created on which there'll be files we uploaded & thing we wrote. 
	    A unique code and link will be provided to you after room creation, only through which you/anyone can access that Room. 
	    (Validation time: that Room you created will automatically be deleted after that validation time expires, and anyone won't be able to access that room.
	    It ensures privacy & temporary use of storage. But it won't work RN cause Iâ€™m using the free tier.)`
