# Life of an idea

I've heard a lot of times, an idea should not deserve a life, it should earn it.

It's been months, and almost the only job as a founder for me till now has been talking with users and improving the product. After a certain time, we get stuck, we don't know where to go, we lose momentum, we lose belief, and probably this is how ideas die—quietly and slowly the core person who was willing it into existence gives up.

I intentionally avoided a lot of other fake works. And I learned that onboarding the not-right person is more bad than being alone, so I'm keep going until I find someone I feel right.
Of course there are few things which has kept me going till now.

I've always wanted to do other tasks mainly, beside coding, which I feel I have more knack on, but we don't get those chances early on.

Willing things into existence, giving life to an idea is an extremely hard thing. And it makes me realize the forces which exists today, how much trial and error have been done, how much differently they are shaped and evolved than the original concept.
