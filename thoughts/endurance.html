        <p>So today I watched this The endurance documentary, which about the Ernest Shackleton's Antartic expedition. I've been wanting to read that book since more than 1 year, but it's not available here in Nepal.</p>

        <p>No spoiler!</p>
        
        <p>Few things stuck with me. Actually it's one thing i guess.</p>
        
        <p>It's how optimism really opens the door. How being an optimist and having a hope keeps you going.</p>

        
        <p>Ernest had every reason to give up, almost at every point in their expedition.</p>
        
        
        <p>This stuck to me.</p>
