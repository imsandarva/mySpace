        <div class="content">
            <p>To this point, I've read more than 30 books. At first i had that habit of highlighting sentences which I
                can later come and view, but I slowly learned that won't be much useful. I do still mark or highlight
                point that I think should be thought critically or are imp for me.</p>

            <p>But still I rarely open old books and check those. Because there are lots of them by this point. And when
                I read book, it feels great, and whatever I read, it sticks in me for a few moment after I close the
                book. But still when I try to remember what I just read a few hours later, it's hard for me to remember
                key things.</p>

            <p>So this raises a question about what am I reading? if I can't stick smth into my head, why even read it?
                why even pour that time and energy to know those informations if I can't remember ~99% of it a year
                later?</p>

            <p>First of all, I realized that this differs book by book. Some book, even though I tend to not remember a
                lot of its exact things as said, it still changes my world view a lot. There are lots of books like this
                for me, actually almost all books are like this for me. When I force myself and try to remember few key
                things from a particular book i've read, it's super hard, and I won't be able to do that correcty a lot.
                I do will remember few key things, but that's more like a context and story rather than actual few 'key
                points'. But even though I tend to remember super less, every book i've read to this point have affected
                my world view and how think about things or perceive world in general. And some did a lot, and others
                not much.</p>

            <p>So when I question, why should I read even though I tend to remember super less of what I've read to this
                point, what should the answer be? Probably reading is just a thinking exercise with a few new ways to
                look at the world? it does seem so. So I don't need to remember things from book I read? Idk. I do
                remember things, it's not that I completely forget everything. Like whenever a context arises or
                something happens that relates to what I read in books in past, that comes up in automatically, so I
                guess there's that context still that is sitting there, and that gets only remembered when something
                related happens.</p>

            <p>But whatever, probably we'll be reading a lots of books throughout our life, and probably 'remembering
                key points from what we read' is less important than that book affecting us or changing our world view
                or just making us think more critically about things. At the end it should change or effect, even if
                it's slight, the way we think or reason about things and perceive the world. Because within a few
                decades we won't be here.</p>
